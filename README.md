# Airbnb Clone Project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development (Python Django, SQL, Redis, Docker, CI/CD), focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project fosters the understanding of complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

# Team Roles

+ Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
+ DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
+ QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
+ Project Manager: Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget

# Technology Stack
+ Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
+ Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
+ PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
+ GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
+ Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
+ Redis: Used for caching and session management.
+ Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
+ CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

`payment_id` (Primary Key),

`booking_id` (Foreign Key → Bookings),

`amount`, 

`payment_method`, 

`payment_status`,

`paid_at`

Relationships:

A payment is linked to one booking. (1 - 1)

# Feature Breakdown

1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication / User Managerment
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

# API Security

🔐 1. Authentication:
Ensures users are who they say they are—typically via login forms, password hashing, and optional two-factor authentication (2FA).

Why it matters: Protects user accounts from unauthorized access. Without it, malicious actors could impersonate users, steal personal data, or hijack bookings.

🛂 2. Authorization:
Controls what users are allowed to do once authenticated. A guest shouldn't access host dashboards, and vice versa.

Why it matters: Prevents privilege escalation and data leakage—especially important for separating sensitive operations like payouts or modifying listings.

🔄 3. Rate Limiting & Throttling:
Limits how often a user or IP can hit your APIs.

Why it matters: Mitigates brute-force attacks (like guessing passwords), spam, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

🔒 4. Secure Payment Processing:
Use third-party payment processors like Stripe or PayPal over secure HTTPS connections. Do not store raw credit card data.

Why it matters: Financial data is high-stakes—if compromised, it erodes user trust and could expose your company to legal penalties.

📡 5. HTTPS & Data Encryption: 
All communication between clients and servers must use HTTPS. Sensitive data like passwords should be hashed and encrypted in transit and at rest.

Why it matters: Protects against eavesdropping and data interception, especially on public networks.

🧼 6. Input Validation & Sanitization: 
Sanitize inputs on both client and server sides to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other common attacks.

Why it matters: User input is the number one attack vector. A single unsanitized field could compromise your entire database.

🧩 7. Logging & Monitoring:
Track suspicious behavior, failed login attempts, and system anomalies through logs and alerting systems.

Why it matters: Helps you detect attacks early and respond before real damage is done.

🔁 8. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Assigns different levels of access (guest, host, admin) based on roles.

Why it matters: Reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of features and ensures users only see what they’re meant to.
